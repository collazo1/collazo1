My name is John Anderson Rivas Collazo. I am from a community called Bahía Málaga la Plata, it is a remote rural area. The city is where I grew up with my family and went to school, which by the way was an incredible time with some limitations such as the lack of internet coverage and also, therefore, we did not have a room with computer equipment to carry out the classes of systems the positive of all this that I read a lot in the library of topics related to computing.

Years later I arrived in the city where I finished my high school in a technical school and my curiosity about the development after that began and my lack of computer skills began to watch tutorials on YouTube to understand the operation of many topics and complement with what that they taught me at school, for reasons of life I had to return to my community to carry out craft activities and I stayed that way for a long time.

Currently I am doing my practices of analysis and development of information systems which has been a process of much learning which I want to maintain for a long time. I am not good at writing but I have discovered this platform and I want to share my learning process that I am going through, I am currently studying on the plazit platform and I will be sharing my learning with you.
